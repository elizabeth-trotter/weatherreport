**Name:** Elizabeth Trotter

**Project Description:** The objective of this project was to rebuild a weather application with `Next.js`, `TypeScript`, and `TailwindCSS`. Data retrieval was accomplished through the `OpenWeatherAPI`. Extensive data manipulation was necessary via helper functions to align with the specifications outlined in the prototype design. There were many challenges to overcome as it was the `first major project` in which I leveraged `Next.js`. 


## Timeline

| Sprint | Description | Tools |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Week 1 | 1. Design a desktop weather application using available data on [OpenWeatherAPI](https://openweathermap.org/api) <br/> 2. Flowchart the logic | `Figma`, `draw.io` | 
| Week 2 | Develop the application based on the prototype designed | `vanilla JavaScript`, `HTML`, `CSS`, `Bootstrap` |
| Week 3 | Rebuild the application with Next.js | `Next.js`, `TypeScript`, `TailwindCSS` |
